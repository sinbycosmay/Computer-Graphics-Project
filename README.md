# Computer-Graphics-Project

This assignment aims to create an interactive system using WebGL and Three.js 
for rendering 3D animations which are capable of basic 3D translation and rotation as done in the previous assignment,
with the ability to detect collisions. The scene deals with multiple light sources. It also deals with using blender to create the 3D Models.


# BACKGROUND
Earth is being attacked by monsters, and we are looking at the city of Bangalore where even after a monster attack,
people are still late for their jobs so they want to avoid the monsters and move on with their lives. 
The Government has also set up a lighthouse in the middle of the road to keep an eye on the monsters while the army arrives to fight them.
